# Makefile — the local quality gate for order-management.
#
# Every target below mirrors a sensor in .github/workflows/ci.yml, so the same
# feedback CI gives you post-push is available locally, pre-commit. This is the
# "keep quality left" idea: shift the sensors left so an agent (or a human) can
# self-correct before code leaves the machine.
#
# See CLAUDE.md -> "Local quality gate".
#
# Restored to fleet parity 2026-09-13: bdd/arch-test/mutation/mutation-fast/
# vuln targets were shipped in PR #34 then silently dropped from this file
# in PR #35's "harden security" pass, even though the backing files
# (.gremlins.yaml, features/*.feature, internal/architecture/) were never
# removed. check-all now matches the rest of the fleet's shape (check +
# coverage + arch-test + bdd) instead of stopping at coverage alone.

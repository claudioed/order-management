description: Hexagonal / ports-and-adapters layering, the strict dependency rule, and how it maps to Order Management's actual code.

# Architecture

The service is **hexagonal (ports & adapters)** with one non-negotiable rule:

> **domain depends on nothing; application depends on domain; adapters
> depend on application/domain.**

No framework type, no `chi` router, no `pgx` connection, and no SQL string
ever appears inside `internal/domain/`.

Solid arrows are compile-time imports; dashed arrows are interface
satisfaction. No arrow points from the application layer into an adapter —
the application only ever names an interface in `application/ports`, and
`cmd/order/main.go` is the only place that decides which implementation
gets plugged in. See [ADR 0001](/docs/adr/0001-hexagonal-ports-and-adapters).
The rule is enforced by `internal/architecture` (the `arch-test` CI job).

## Ports

| Port | Responsibility | Implementations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OrderRepo` | Persist/retrieve `Order`; mint IDs | `postgres`, `memory` |
| `EventPublisher` | Publish a `shared.DomainEvent` | `events` (log), `postgres` (event table), `kafka` (integration + analytics fan-out) |
| `Clock` | `Now()` — makes promise computation deterministic in tests | `memory.SystemClock`, fixed clocks in tests |
| `OrderMetrics` | Order accepted/rejected counter | `telemetry` (OpenTelemetry) |
| `InventoryReservationClient` | `Reserve`/`Revoke` against inventory-storage | `outbound/inventorystorage` (http), permissive no-op |
| `ProductClassificationLookup` | Product attributes for path eligibility (ADR 0016) | `outbound/productclassification` (http), permissive |
| `ProcessPathCatalogue` | Active paths + capability (ADR 0013/0014) | `outbound/kafkacatalog` |
| `CPTScheduleCache` | Site CPT schedule (ADR 0014) | `outbound/kafkacptschedule` |
| `PathCapacity` | Remaining path capacity per cutoff (ADR 0015) | `outbound/kafkapathcapacity`, `pathcapacity.Unknown` |
| `RepromiseProcessedEvents` | Idempotency gate for the re-promise consumer (ADR 0018) | `postgres`, `memory` |

Both inventory-storage ports are env-selected `MODE=http|permissive`
(defaulting to `permissive`, so unit tests never hit the network). The
classification lookup fails open like the fleet's other soft lookups; the
reservation client does not — allocation against a permissive client
returns a clear `ErrDownstreamNotConfigured` rather than a fabricated
success. Only `http` mode is suitable for a real integration test or
deployment.

## Composition root

`cmd/order/main.go` is the only file that reads environment variables and
the only file that knows both a port and its implementation:

| Env var | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HTTP_ADDR` | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | slog level |
| `DATABASE_URL` | *(unset)* | If unset, the in-memory adapters are used and no database is required. |
| `MIGRATIONS_PATH` | `migrations` | Where golang-migrate looks for SQL files |
| `INVENTORY_STORAGE_MODE` | `permissive` | `http` or `permissive` |
| `INVENTORY_STORAGE_BASE_URL` | *(unset)* | Required when mode is `http`; also used by the classification lookup |
| `PRODUCT_CLASSIFICATION_MODE` | `permissive` | `http` or `permissive` (ADR 0016) |
| `EVENT_PUBLISHER` | `log` | `kafka` adds the integration + analytics topics |
| `KAFKA_BROKERS` | `localhost:9092` when publishing; unset disables the re-promise consumer | Comma-separated brokers |
| `PATH_CATALOGUE_SOURCE` | `none` | `kafka` enables the catalogue, CPT-schedule and path-capacity caches (capability promise); `none` = lead-time promise only |
| `PROMISE_DEFAULT_LEAD_TIME` | `48h` | Lead-time fallback for any unlisted path |
| `PROMISE_PATH_LEAD_TIMES` | *(unset)* | Per-path overrides, e.g. `pick=24h,singles=6h` |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | *(unset)* | Console / MFE origins (ADR 0007) |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | *(unset)* | OpenTelemetry export |

The in-memory fallback is deliberate: `go run ./cmd/order` with no
environment at all starts a fully functional service, which is what makes
the `httptest` suite cheap to run.

## Quality gates

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request:

| Job | What it enforces |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` | `golangci-lint` against the committed `.golangci.yml` |
| `test` | Unit tests with `-race`; coverage gate on `internal/domain/...,internal/application/...` |
| `bdd` | godog/Gherkin acceptance tests (`TestFeatures`) |
| `integration` | Kafka adapters against Testcontainers Kafka |
| `mutation-fast` | gremlins on the domain layer, thresholds in `.gremlins.yaml` |
| `vuln` | `govulncheck` |
| `api-lint` | Spectral on `apis/openapi.yaml` / `apis/asyncapi.yaml` |
| `arch-test` | The hexagonal dependency rule (`internal/architecture`) |
| `docs-api-drift` | Regenerates the REST reference and diffs it |
| `helm-lint` | `charts/order-management` |
| `web` | The MFE: lint, typecheck, test, build |
| `trivy-scan`, `docker-publish`, `release` | Image scan, publish, GitFlow release |

`mutation` (full) and `drift` run only on schedule / manual dispatch. This
documentation site is built and deployed by a separate workflow,
`.github/workflows/docs.yml`.

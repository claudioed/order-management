# 18. RepromiseOrder consumer and OrderRepromised — closing ADR 0014's feedback loop

## Status

Accepted — implemented in the same change that introduces this record.
This is the final piece of [ADR 0014](/docs/adr/0014-promise-derived-from-fulfillment-capability)'s
entire rollout: Phase 0 (the ADR pair with process-path-management's ADR
0010) through Phase 5 (this record) are now all shipped. Companion to
fulfillment-execution's own ADR 0025 (`TaskCPTMissed` sweep and
`PackageManifested` on the outbox), which ADR 0014 §5 explicitly deferred
to "fulfillment-execution's own ADR" and which has since been accepted,
implemented, and merged on that repo's `develop`. That ADR's own text
says as much: "order-management's `RepromiseOrder` consumer is out of
scope here entirely — a separate, later task." This is that task.

## Context

ADR 0014 §5 named the shape of the feedback loop but explicitly deferred
building it until fulfillment-execution's companion events existed on
the wire. They now do — real, shipped, verified via `git show
origin/develop` on that repo:

Envelope for `TaskCPTMissed` (a task still open past its CPT):

```json
{"event_id": "...", "event_type": "TaskCPTMissed", "occurred_at": "...", "source": "fulfillment-execution",
 "data": {"task_id": "...", "order_ref": "...", "task_type": "PICK|PACK|SLAM|REBIN", "cpt": "2026-.. RFC3339"}}
```

Envelope for `PackageManifested` (a SLAM pass):

```json
{"event_id": "...", "event_type": "PackageManifested", "occurred_at": "...", "source": "fulfillment-execution",
 "data": {"package_id": "...", "order_ref": "..."}}
```

Both are published on `warehouse.fulfillment.events` — the SAME
shared/fan-out topic labor-performance already consumes for
`TaskCompleted`, per this fleet's established one-topic-many-consumers
convention on that topic.

**The non-obvious finding this ADR is built around**: `order_ref` on
both events is fulfillment-execution's `Task.OrderRef()` /
`Package.OrderRef()`, populated at task-creation time from
`WorkReleasedData.WorkUnitId` (see that repo's
`internal/adapters/inbound/kafka/consumer.go`:
`orderRef := shared.OrderRef(env.Data.WorkUnitId)`). `WorkUnitId` is
wes-work-planning's per-LINE identifier, itself derived from **this
repo's own frozen formula**, `usecases.WorkUnitID`
(`internal/application/usecases/allocation.go`):

```go
func WorkUnitID(orderID shared.OrderId, lineNo int) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s-line-%d", orderID.String(), lineNo)
}
```

So `order_ref` on the wire looks like
`"ord-7c9e6679-...-line-2"` — NOT a bare `OrderId`. A naive consumer
treating `order_ref` as an `OrderId` would silently corrupt every lookup
(`FindByID("ord-...-line-2")` never matches a real order). The consumer
must parse it back apart to recover both the `OrderId` and the specific
`lineNo` the missed task/manifested package belongs to.

Both facts are already scoped to a single LINE. Per ADR 0017 (already
shipped), a line belongs to exactly one `PromiseGroup` — the shipment
group it was promised as part of. ADR 0014 §5's "recompute the promise
for the affected shipment group" is therefore precisely: find the
`PromiseGroup` containing the affected `lineNo`, and recompute it.

## Decision

### 1. `usecases.ParseWorkUnitID` — the reverse of `WorkUnitID`, never a panic

```go
func ParseWorkUnitID(workUnitID string) (orderID shared.OrderId, lineNo int, ok bool)
```

It splits on the **last** occurrence of the `"-line-"` marker, not the
first. This repo's real `OrderId` values (`"ord-" + uuid.NewString()`,
see `OrderRepo.NextID`) are hex digits and hyphens only and can never
contain the literal substring `"line"` — so first-vs-last split is not
observable against this repo's real data today. Splitting on the last
occurrence is still the deliberately safer choice: it degrades correctly
even against a hypothetical future `OrderId` shape that legitimately
contains `"-line-"` as a substring, where a first-occurrence split would
silently truncate the order id and misattribute the line number. `ok` is
`false` — never a panic — for anything that isn't a positive integer
trailing an order id via that exact marker (no marker, empty order-id
portion, non-numeric or non-positive line number, trailing garbage).
Round-trip and malformed-input tests pin this exactly (see
`allocation_test.go`).

### 2. `RepromiseOrder` — reuse `PromisePolicy.PromiseGroups`, don't reinvent promise math

```go
type RepromiseOrder struct {
	Orders    ports.OrderRepo
	Promise   order.PromisePolicy
	Events    ports.EventPublisher
	Clock     ports.Clock
	Processed ports.RepromiseProcessedEvents
	Logger    *slog.Logger
}
```

`Execute` does exactly what ADR 0014 §5 describes, using ADR 0017's
already-shipped recompute unchanged:

1. Idempotency check via `Processed.MarkProcessed` — no-op if already
   evaluated.
2. Load the `Order`.
3. Find the line's **current** `PromiseGroup` (from `o.PromiseGroups()`).
4. Call `PromisePolicy.PromiseGroups(now, o)` — the SAME domain service
   ADR 0017 introduced for per-group promising, called again fresh, from
   whatever capability/capacity inputs are current now.
5. Find the line's **fresh** `PromiseGroup` in that new result.
6. Compare the two `Promise` values (`CptId`/`Basis`/`CutoffAt` — any one
   differing counts as "moved", not just `CptId` alone, so a
   same-CPT-identity cutoff shift or a basis flip is never missed). If
   moved: `o.SetPromiseGroups(freshGroups)`, `Orders.Save`,
   `Events.Publish(NewOrderRepromised(...))`.
7. Mark processed regardless of whether the promise moved — idempotency
   covers "already evaluated this event", not "already moved".

No new promise-computation logic was written. This is deliberate,
per this repo's own established pattern of extending rather than
replacing: `PromisePolicy.PromiseGroups` already IS "recompute the
promise for the affected shipment group from the current
capability/capacity inputs" — RepromiseOrder's only real job is finding
which group to compare before and after.

**Fail-soft, not fail-hard, for every "this signal doesn't map to a
live, promotable order line" condition**: order not found, `lineNo` not
present in any current group (a stale/already-cancelled line, or an
order never allocated), or the fresh recompute has nothing to promise at
all (`PromisePolicy.PromiseGroups`' own `ok=false`). Each of these is
logged and treated as a no-op — never an error returned to the Kafka
consumer — mirroring this fleet's convention for a soft reconciliation
input (the same permissive spirit as a SKU-not-found lookup elsewhere in
the fleet, not a hard business-rule violation). Only a genuine
infrastructure failure (`Processed`/`Orders`/`Events` erroring) is
returned.

`Orders.Save` then `Events.Publish` run sequentially, matching this
repo's OWN existing convention (see `allocation.go`'s
`allocateAndRelease`) — no transactional wrapper was invented.
**This repo has no `UnitOfWork`/transactional-outbox port at all**
(unlike fulfillment-execution/labor-performance), and introducing one
here would be over-engineering relative to the fleet's stated intent for
this repo.

### 3. Idempotency key: `event_id` alone, not the full `(orderId, sourceEventId)` composite

ADR 0014 §5's own words: `RepromiseOrder` is idempotent on
`(orderId, sourceEventId)`. This ADR implements it as **`event_id`
alone**. The simplification is deliberate and documented, not a silent
substitution: `event_id` is already globally unique per message — every
publisher in this fleet mints it with `uuid.NewString()` — so scoping
the check by `orderId` too is redundant. Two different orders can never
coincidentally share the same `event_id`, and the SAME `event_id` always
refers to the SAME order. The composite key buys nothing a UUID
collision wouldn't already rule out, at the cost of a wider index. Either
choice is defensible; this is the simpler one, chosen and stated
honestly (see `ports.RepromiseProcessedEvents`' doc comment).

A NEW, OLTP-side port was added for this: `ports.RepromiseProcessedEvents`.
This repo's only existing `ProcessedEvents`-shaped interface
(`internal/adapters/inbound/kafka/analytics_consumer.go`) is declared
**local to that file** specifically so the analytics side owns its own
port and the OLTP application layer stays untouched — its own doc
comment says so. `RepromiseOrder` is OLTP-side (it mutates the real
`Order` aggregate and publishes a real integration event), so it needed
its own port rather than reusing that one.

Postgres-backed implementation: new migration `0004_repromise_processed_events`,
a `(event_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ)` table —
mirroring labor-performance's own `processed_events` migration shape
exactly, the proven precedent for this exact table shape in this fleet
— named `repromise_processed_events`, not `processed_events`, so a
future OLTP-side consumer added to this service never collides with
this one's table by accident.

**Why idempotency matters here specifically**: fulfillment-execution's
`SweepCPTMisses` (its ADR 0025 §4) re-fires `TaskCPTMissed` on **every
sweep pass** for as long as a task stays overdue — a deliberate design
choice on that side, explicitly justified by citing this ADR's own
idempotency requirement. Without a real idempotency gate here, every
sweep tick would re-evaluate (and, worse, the fail-soft "already moved"
outcome notwithstanding, could theoretically re-publish) the same fact.
An integration test in this repo
(`TestHandleFulfillmentEvent_MimicsFulfillmentExecutionSweepReemission`)
pins exactly this: two DIFFERENT `event_id`s for the same overdue task
are both evaluated (never deduped away, since the ids differ), but only
the first actually moves the promise — the second sees no further
movement and publishes nothing.

### 4. `OrderRepromised` — the fleet's "your delivery is delayed" trigger

```go
type OrderRepromised struct {
	base
	OrderID  OrderId
	CptIdOld string // may be empty (LeadTime-basis previous promise had no CPT identity)
	CptIdNew string // may be empty (LeadTime-basis new promise)
	Reason   string // "TaskCPTMissed" | "PackageManifested" — verbatim fulfillment-execution event_type
}
```

`Reason` carries the triggering fulfillment-execution `event_type`
verbatim — `"TaskCPTMissed"` or `"PackageManifested"` — rather than a
paraphrased sentence, so a downstream reader can distinguish "still
open past CPT" from "a SLAM pass revealed a new capacity/eligibility
picture" without a second lookup. `CptIdOld`/`CptIdNew` may independently
be empty: a `LeadTime`-basis promise (either side) has no CPT departure
identity at all, only a computed cutoff instant — this mirrors
`order.Promise`'s own existing `CptId` semantics exactly (see
`promise_basis.go`'s doc comment) rather than inventing a new
empty-vs-nil convention.

Published on `warehouse.order-management.events` — the SAME existing
integration topic `OrderAllocated`/`OrderPartiallyAllocated` already
use, additively (a new `case` in `internal/adapters/outbound/kafka/publisher.go`'s
type switch, `cpt_id_old`/`cpt_id_new` both `omitempty`). Nothing about
the existing wire shape changed; a consumer reading only
`OrderAllocated` sees zero behavior change.

### 5. The inbound consumer — stable shared group, NOT per-process-unique

`internal/adapters/inbound/kafka/repromise_consumer.go` decodes the
fleet envelope, filters strictly for `TaskCPTMissed`/`PackageManifested`
(every other event type on this shared topic — including anything
fulfillment-execution someday adds — is silently skipped, mirroring
labor-performance's own consumer's convention on this exact topic),
parses `order_ref` via `ParseWorkUnitID`, and drives `RepromiseOrder.Execute`.

**Consumer group**: `order-management-repromise`, a fixed, shared
constant — deliberately NOT a per-process-unique group. This distinction
matters and is easy to get backwards: this repo's OTHER three Kafka
consumers (`kafkacatalog`, `kafkacptschedule`, `kafkapathcapacity`) build
a full in-memory read-model cache by replaying their topic from
`FirstOffset` on every start, and per-process-unique groups are a
correctness REQUIREMENT for that pattern (a shared group there lets a
new process resume from a prior process's committed offset and report
itself ready with an empty cache, having never actually replayed
anything — a real, previously-hit bug class in this fleet). This
consumer is a DIFFERENT shape entirely: a normal at-least-once "process
each new message once, commit as you go" consumer, structurally
identical to labor-performance's own `TaskCompleted` consumer on this
same topic. Using a per-process-unique group here would be the wrong
fix applied to the wrong pattern: every restart would replay the ENTIRE
topic history from the beginning, re-driving `RepromiseOrder` for years
of already-handled messages. `RepromiseOrder`'s own event_id idempotency
gate makes that merely wasteful rather than corrupting, but it is still
the wrong behavior — a shared, stable group is correct here specifically
because ordinary Kafka consumer-group semantics (resume from the
group's last committed offset) are exactly what this pattern wants.

Malformed/unparseable messages (bad JSON, an `order_ref` that doesn't
parse as a `WorkUnitId`) are logged and committed — never redelivered
forever, never a crash — mirroring every other Kafka consumer in this
fleet's malformed-message handling. Only a genuine infrastructure
failure from `RepromiseOrder.Execute` itself aborts the consume loop,
consistent with `RepromiseOrder`'s own fail-soft/fail-hard split.

Wired in `cmd/order/main.go` gated on `KAFKA_BROKERS` alone (independent
of `PATH_CATALOGUE_SOURCE`/`EVENT_PUBLISHER`), the same
`KAFKA_BROKERS`-gated-conditional-construction-plus-goroutine-`Run`-loop
convention this repo already uses for its other Kafka consumers.

## Consequences

**Easier**

- ADR 0014's entire rollout — Phases 0 through 5 — is now complete. A
  missed CPT or a SLAM pass genuinely reaches the order that is waiting
  on it, and the promise it carries is recomputed from the SAME real
  capability/capacity inputs `PromisePolicy` already uses everywhere
  else, not a bespoke recompute.
- No new promise-computation logic exists anywhere in this codebase.
  `PromisePolicy.PromiseGroups` is the ONE place that logic lives,
  reused unchanged by both the intake path (`allocateAndRelease`) and
  this feedback-loop path.
- The idempotency simplification (event_id-only) is honestly documented
  rather than silently chosen, and is provably safe given every
  publisher's UUID-based `event_id` minting.

**Harder**

- `RepromiseOrder`'s fail-soft posture means a genuinely broken
  `order_ref`/parsing bug on fulfillment-execution's side would be
  silently absorbed here (logged, never surfaced as an error) rather
  than loudly failing. This is the deliberate, stated trade for a soft
  reconciliation input — the alternative (treating every unmatched line
  as an error) would make this consumer fragile against completely
  routine conditions (a cancelled line, an order that finished
  shipping before its sweep-reported task caught up).
- `OrderRepromised` is a trigger, not a notification — nothing in this
  fleet contacts a customer. A future notification context would
  subscribe to this event, not be built here.
- This closes the LAST open step in ADR 0014's rollout. Phase 6
  (KPIs/MCP tools/e2e-tests scenarios for the promise feedback loop) is
  explicitly deferred to a separate, later task — not started here.

## Alternatives considered

- **Composite `(orderId, sourceEventId)` idempotency key**, matching ADR
  0014 §5's literal words. Rejected in favor of `event_id`-alone: see
  §3 above — the composite key is provably redundant given globally
  unique `event_id`s, and the simpler key is easier to reason about and
  index.
- **A per-process-unique consumer group**, mirroring this repo's other
  three Kafka consumers. Rejected: those three build a full-replay
  local cache, a genuinely different correctness shape from this
  normal at-least-once "process and commit" consumer. Applying that
  pattern here would replay years of history on every restart — see §5.
- **New promise-recompute logic scoped specifically to a
  repromise event**, rather than reusing `PromisePolicy.PromiseGroups`.
  Rejected: `PromiseGroups` already computes exactly what ADR 0014 §5
  asks for ("recompute the promise for the affected shipment group from
  the current capability/capacity inputs"); a second implementation
  would only risk drifting from the intake path's behavior.
- **Reusing the analytics consumer's local `ProcessedEvents` interface**
  instead of a new OLTP-side port. Rejected: that interface is
  deliberately scoped to the analytics side by its own doc comment —
  reusing it would blur a boundary this repo already drew on purpose.

## Verification performed

All run locally in the worktree before pushing; every command below
produced the quoted result.

- `gofmt -l .`: clean (no output).
- `go vet ./...`, `go vet -tags=integration ./...`: clean.
- `make check` (fmt-check, vet, build, lint, test -race): all green,
  `golangci-lint run ./...` → `0 issues.`
- `make coverage`: **93.6%** on
  `./internal/domain/...,./internal/application/...` (gate: 90%).
- `make arch-test`: all hexagonal/analytics-isolation/ports/MCP-boundary/
  auth-revert/Kafka-consumer-group fitness tests pass, including
  `TestKafkaConsumerGroupNeverHardcodedInline` (the new
  `RepromiseConsumerGroup` constant is a named symbol, never an inline
  literal).
- `make bdd`: unaffected, all pre-existing scenarios still pass.
- `make mutation-fast`: **Test efficacy: 91.30%, Mutator coverage:
  87.34%** (gate: 89%/83%) — Killed 63, Lived 6, Not covered 10, all
  pre-existing survivors on `promise.go`/`promise_policy.go` this ADR
  did not touch; no new survivors introduced.
- `make integration`: all green, including the new
  `internal/adapters/inbound/kafka` testcontainers suite
  (`TestRepromiseConsumer_RealTaskCPTMissedMessage_DrivesRepromiseOrder`,
  28.163s) — a real `TaskCPTMissed` message on a real Kafka broker,
  fulfillment-execution's exact shipped envelope/payload shape,
  correctly drives `RepromiseOrder.Execute` end to end: the order's
  persisted `PromiseGroups` breakdown changes and a real
  `OrderRepromised` is published.
- Every existing test still passes unmodified.

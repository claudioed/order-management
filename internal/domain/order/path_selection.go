// EligibilitySource is the catalogue question PathSelectionPolicy needs:
// a path's declared Eligibility rule (single-id, kept for callers that
// only need that), plus ListActive (ADR-0021) so this policy can
// enumerate every currently active path rather than only ever evaluating
// one hardcoded candidate. Any adapter satisfying
// ports.ProcessPathCatalogue's superset of methods satisfies this
// narrower domain-owned interface automatically (Go's structural
// interface-to-interface assignability), exactly the pattern
// PromisePolicy's CapabilitySource/ScheduleSource/CapacitySource already
// use — no adapter code needs to know this type exists. A nil
// EligibilitySource, or one whose ListActive returns nothing, is a
// legal, tested value: Select then falls back to today's behaviour,
// exactly ADR-0013's original floor.

// PathSelectionPolicy decides which wes-work-planning process path an
// OrderLine's work should be enqueued onto, based on attributes known at
// intake (SKU, Quantity, GiftWrap) and the line's derived product
// attributes (e.g. "hazmat", "fragile", looked up via the fleet's
// product-classification sync edge -- see ReceiveOrder), evaluated
// against every currently active path's declared Eligibility. It is a
// pure domain policy: no I/O of its own. The application layer
// (ReceiveOrder) performs the classification lookup and passes plain
// values in, and supplies the EligibilitySource so this type never
// touches Kafka/HTTP.
//
// History: ADR-0013 shipped v1 with exactly one rule ("every line
// resolves to shared.DefaultPathId") and deliberately deferred
// attribute-driven routing until real eligibility data existed. ADR-0016
// (step B of ADR-0014) made this type evaluate Eligibility for real, but
// only against that one hardcoded candidate -- it had no way to discover
// a genuinely different, eligible alternative when DefaultPathId's own
// Eligibility rejected a line, a limitation ADR-0016 §4 documented
// explicitly. ADR-0021 closes that gap: EligibilitySource.ListActive
// gives this policy every currently active path, so it can filter to the
// eligible subset and pick the best one, rather than reject a line the
// fleet's real catalogue could actually carry on some other path.

// giftWrapAttribute is the product-attribute-vocabulary string this
// policy uses to represent "this line requested gift wrap" when
// evaluating it against a path's declared RequiredProductAttributes /
// ExcludedProductAttributes -- the same free-form vocabulary as
// "hazmat"/"fragile" (see shared.Eligibility's doc comment, which
// explicitly lists "giftWrap" alongside them).

// Select resolves the PathId for a line described by sku, quantity,
// giftWrap and productAttributes (free-form strings from the fleet's
// existing product-classification vocabulary, e.g. "hazmat", "fragile",
// looked up via ReceiveOrder's classification lookup -- sku itself is
// accepted for symmetry with ADR-0013's original signature and so a
// future rule keyed directly on SKU needs no signature change again).
//
// catalogue is consulted via ListActive (ADR-0021) for every currently
// active path's declared Eligibility and CycleTimeP95. A nil catalogue,
// or one whose ListActive() returns no candidates, fails OPEN to
// shared.DefaultPathId (ok=true) -- missing catalogue data is a
// "not yet wired" state, never a rejection trigger, matching this
// fleet's established convention for a read-only membership/eligibility
// check.
//
// Among the candidates the line is eligible for, this policy picks the
// one with the shortest KNOWN CycleTimeP95 (ADR-0014 §4's original
// rule); a candidate whose cycle time is not yet known sorts after every
// candidate with a known one, but remains pickable if it is the only
// eligible candidate. Ties (identical known cycle time, or all
// candidates cycle-time-unknown) break on the lower PathId, so the same
// inputs against an unchanged catalogue always resolve the same way.
//
// ok=false means: no currently active path's declared Eligibility admits
// this line. The returned PathId is the zero value in that case; callers
// must not use it.

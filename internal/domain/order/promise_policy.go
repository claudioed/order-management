// stamped on it (network-fulfillment ADR 0001) and require a whole-order
// commit or reject inside a fixed acknowledgement window. That inverts
// the question this policy was built to answer, but NOT the machinery

// as the departure we are now on the hook for.
//
// Of the qualifying windows it returns the LATEST, not the earliest.
// See the loop below for why; it is the opposite of Promise's choice
// and deliberate.
//
// Deliberately NOT symmetric with Promise in one respect: there is no
// LeadTimePolicy fallback. Promise falls back because a building that
// cannot say WHEN is still a building that will ship — an approximate
// internal promise beats refusing to take the order. A feasibility
// answer cannot borrow that reasoning: ok=true here becomes a
// fill-or-kill commitment to an external party who measures us on it,
// and a guess dressed as a commitment is how a vendor loses its
// account. Missing schedule, missing capability, unknown cycle time or
// an empty horizon therefore all return false — "we cannot show this is
// feasible", never "probably fine".
//

// will look like a bug the first time someone sees it. It is not. The

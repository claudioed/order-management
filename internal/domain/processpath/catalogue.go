// Package processpath models the fleet's process-path catalogue as a
// small, read-only lookup: which process-path families are currently
// active, matched by prefix. This package mirrors wes-work-planning's
// and fulfillment-execution's own pathcatalog package byte-for-byte in
// its matching semantics -- all three read the same published-language
// events from process-path-management, so they must agree. See
// wes-work-planning's ADR-0017 (and its addendum) for the full history
// of why an earlier exact-match version of this idea was wrong, and
// order-management's own ADR-0013 for why this context needs the
// catalogue at all: an OrderLine's resolved PathId is validated against
// it before the order is ever persisted, rather than being discovered
// wrong one saga step later in wes-work-planning.
//
// order-management deliberately keeps a SMALLER shape than WES/FE's
// copy for the fields it does not need: RequiredCapabilities and Direct
// are still not carried here. ADR-0014 step A DOES widen this struct
// with CycleTimeP95 and Eligibility, since order.PromisePolicy is a real
// consumer of both — see the kafkacatalog package doc comment for the
// wire-decoding side of that widening.

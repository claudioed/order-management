// RetryAllocation re-attempts allocation for the order's Backordered lines
// and ONLY those lines. It is the single sanctioned route from Backordered
// back to Allocated (Order.RetryAllocate) — nothing else in the system may
// perform that transition.
//
// It is also what unblocks a ship-complete order: while any line is
// Backordered, BR3 holds the whole order back from release, and a
// successful retry is the event that clears it.
//
// A line that is still short of stock stays Backordered; the same
// 409-is-a-business-fact / anything-else-is-ambiguous rule as allocation
// applies.
//
// Per the choreographed-release redesign (ADR 0005), RetryAllocation now
// ALSO attempts release in the same call once allocation succeeds — the
// same allocateAndRelease flow ReceiveOrder uses. UNLIKE ReceiveOrder,
// RetryAllocation is an explicit, on-purpose operator/recovery action: its
// caller's whole intent IS "attempt allocation (and, if that clears BR3,
// release) right now". So — unlike ReceiveOrder's best-effort, error-
// swallowing treatment of a hard failure — RetryAllocation keeps
// propagating a hard failure to its own caller exactly as it did
// pre-redesign, matching its existing error-return behaviour.

// ReleaseHeldOrder releases the already-allocated lines of an order
// received with releaseOnAllocation=false (ADR 0020 §1). It is the
// second half of the hold: intake allocates and stops, a caller decides,
// and this commits that decision to the floor.
//
// It reuses allocateAndRelease's release leg rather than reimplementing
// release, by calling it with an EMPTY line set to allocate and
// releaseOnAllocation=true. Nothing is allocated (the lines are already
// Allocated), BR3 is enforced by the same EnsureReleasable gate as every
// other release, the promise is recomputed by the same policy, and the
// same OrderAllocated/OrderReleased outcome event fires with the same
// per-line payload. A second implementation of release would be a second
// thing to keep in sync with ADR 0017's promise-group payload.
//
// IDEMPOTENT by design: an order whose lines are already Released
// returns success with no state change and no event. The caller may be
// retrying after a network failure or a lost response, and must not be
// punished for it — an external caller holding a fill-or-kill deadline
// cannot distinguish "my release was lost" from "my release failed", so
// the safe action for it must be to retry.
//
// It deliberately does NOT clear the hold flag. The flag records what
// the order was received as, not where it is now; line statuses already
// carry the current state. Clearing it would make the order's history
// unreadable and would break the retry-safety it exists to provide.

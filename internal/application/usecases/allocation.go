// Package usecases: shared allocation and release machinery.
//
// Before the choreographed-release redesign, allocation and release were
// two separately invoked public use cases (AllocateOrder, ReleaseOrder)
// driven by their own REST verbs. That exposed internal saga-step
// mechanics as public API: a caller had to know to call /allocate then
// /release, when all it actually wants is to place an order. Both are now
// folded into ONE flow — allocateAndRelease — invoked from inside
// ReceiveOrder (implicitly, right after intake) and RetryAllocation
// (explicitly, as an operator/recovery action). See ADR 0005.

// UNCHANGED Promise(now, o) search (see promise_policy.go's doc
// comment), and Order.SetPromiseGroups called with that single group
// reproduces SetPromise's own field assignment byte for byte. The
// OUTCOME for a ship-complete order is therefore provably identical

// group breakdown yet (e.g. the promise was never computed, or was set

// allocateAndRelease is the ONE shared flow this redesign folds allocation
// and release into. Both ReceiveOrder (implicitly, right after intake) and

// pass (Pending for ReceiveOrder, Backordered for RetryAllocation).
//
// Steps:
//  1. allocateLines — the reserve-per-line loop (unchanged behaviour).
//  2. On a hard (non-business) failure, persist whatever was genuinely
//     reserved before the failure (never stranding a real reservation
//     with nothing in this context able to revoke it) and publish
//     OrderAllocationPartiallyFailed for visibility if anything was
//     reserved. The hard failure is returned to the caller either way —
//     it is each CALLER's decision (see ReceiveOrder vs RetryAllocation)
//     whether to propagate that error to ITS OWN caller, since ReceiveOrder
//     must not fail just because its implicit allocation attempt did.
//  3. On success, apply the promise-date policy, then attempt release:
//     o.EnsureReleasable() enforces BR3 (a ship-complete order releases
//     nothing while any line is unallocated); when it passes, every
//     currently-Allocated line is released via the pure domain transition
//     o.Release, and its released-line detail is collected for the
//     integration event payload.
//  4. Save the order ONCE — covering both the allocation and the release
//     state changes in a single write.
//  5. publishOrderAllocationOutcome exactly once, carrying the lines
//     released in this pass (or nil when release did not run/had nothing
//     to release).
//
// releaseOnAllocation (ADR 0020 §1) gates step 3's release leg. Callers
// pass o.ReleaseOnAllocation(), so the intent is read from the aggregate
// rather than from ambient call-site knowledge — this is what makes a
// LATER RetryAllocation on a held order safe: it re-reads the order from
// the repository and sees the hold, instead of releasing work onto the
// floor for an order nobody committed to. It stays an explicit parameter
// rather than being read from o in here so the release decision is
// visible at every call site.

// nothing else in this module — the OLTP domain and application layers must
// not import it, and it must not import them (ADR-0006).

	// analytics fact (ADR 0018/0019). They share this row's (path_id,
	// hour_bucket) grain except OrdersRepromised — see its own comment.

	// percentage itself, mirroring this read model's existing convention of
	// exposing raw counts rather than precomputed rates.
	PromiseBasisLeadTime int
	// OrdersRepromised is the number of OrderRepromised events in this
	// bucket. UNLIKE every other counter on this row, it carries NO path_id
	// dimension: OrderRepromised (ADR 0018) does not carry a process path,
	// and this data product deliberately does not add an OrderRepo lookup
	// to resolve one (see ADR 0019's documented choice). Every
	// OrderRepromised event therefore lands on the row whose Key.PathId is
	// the empty string "" — the same "path unknown/inapplicable" sentinel
	// this read model already uses when an order lookup misses (see the
	// analytics publisher's best-effort enrichment). A caller wanting the
	// fleet-wide re-promise count for an hour should read the ""-path row;
	// filtering ReportQuery.PathId to a real path will never surface it.

	// OrderPartiallyAllocated events in this bucket whose order had more
	// than one order.PromiseGroup at allocation time (ADR 0014 §3 / ADR
	// 0017) — i.e. lines were promised to different cutoffs. This IS
	// path_id-dimensioned like the funnel counters above (unlike
	// OrdersRepromised) because the triggering event already carries a
	// path.
	OrdersSplitShipment int
	// PromiseToCutoffGapSeconds is the MEAN of (cutoffAt - allocatedAt), in
	// seconds, across every OrderAllocated/OrderPartiallyAllocated event in
	// this bucket that carried a Capability-basis promise with a real
	// cutoffAt. It is zero when no such event landed in this bucket —
	// mirroring fulfillment-execution's own AvgClaimToCompleteSeconds
	// "zero when no completion had a claim" convention. LeadTime-basis
	// promises are excluded: their "cutoff" is just now-plus-a-configured-
	// duration, so the gap would trivially reproduce the configured lead
	// time rather than measure anything about real fulfillment capability.
	PromiseToCutoffGapSeconds float64
	// PromiseToCutoffGapSamples is how many events contributed to
	// PromiseToCutoffGapSeconds's mean for this bucket. Exposed
	// specifically so a caller aggregating PromiseToCutoffGapSeconds
	// across MULTIPLE rows (e.g. get_promise_health summarising a
	// multi-hour/multi-path window) can compute a correctly WEIGHTED
	// mean — averaging several rows' already-computed means unweighted
	// would silently under- or over-count buckets with different sample
	// volumes.

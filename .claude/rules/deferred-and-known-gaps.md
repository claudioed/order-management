# Deferred and known gaps (document them, don't skip silently)

Several items originally listed as "v1 scope — explicitly deferred" have
since SHIPPED (Helm chart + CI packaging jobs, gremlins mutation gate,
godog/BDD acceptance suite, MCP inbound adapter, Kafka integration +
analytics fan-out, Postgres integration suite, arch-go fitness tests,
Spectral api-lint, docs-api-drift, standard metrics/telemetry, fleet MFE
console, FulfillmentClass classifier, capability-derived CPT promise with
per-shipment-group promising and the re-promise loop, network-originated
hold/release and deadline feasibility). CI and the README's "Deferred"
section are the current source of truth; check them, not this list, if you
need to confirm something has NOT shipped yet before treating it as future
work.

Still deferred, as of the last verified pass:

- **Real carrier-rate / transit-time promise.** The promise is a CPT
  window derived from fulfillment capability (ADR-0014; `LeadTimePolicy`
  remains the tagged fallback), i.e. the instant the order leaves the
  building — there is no live carrier or transit-time integration, and no
  such service exists in this fleet to call.
- **Multi-path selection.** `PathSelectionPolicy` evaluates eligibility
  (ADR-0016) but can only choose `shared.DefaultPathId`:
  `ports.ProcessPathCatalogue` has no "list active paths" method.
- **Sweeping an orphaned hold (ADR-0020).** Nothing here expires an order
  held with `releaseOnAllocation=false` that its caller never releases or
  cancels — it keeps real inventory reservations until someone does.
- **A dedicated problem type for `ErrHeldOrderMustBeShipComplete`.** It
  maps to 422 in `statusFor` but has no `problemFor` case, so its RFC 7807
  `type` is `internal-error`.
- **Kafka release-confirmation reply events from wes-work-planning.**
  v1 (ADR-0005) ships fire-and-forget: this service publishes
  `OrderAllocated`/`OrderPartiallyAllocated` and never learns whether
  `wes-work-planning`'s consumer actually processed the event or
  successfully enqueued its own work. Mirrors `inventory-storage`'s own
  ADR-0004 stance on transactional guarantees, not an oversight.
- **Clawing back released work on cancellation.** BR6 (ADR-0004): once any
  line is `Released`, v1 does NOT claw it back on `CancelOrder`.
- **Killing the surviving `promise.go`/`promise_policy.go` boundary
  mutants.** The mutation gate is pinned just under the measured baseline
  (thresholds efficacy 89 / mutant-coverage 83, measured 89.29% / 83.58% —
  see `.gremlins.yaml`); hardening those tests to ratchet toward the
  fleet's 99/99 target is tracked follow-up work, not a
  currently-enforced requirement.
- **Any change to `inventory-storage` or `wes-work-planning`.** This
  repo's entire build is 100% additive from their point of view — neither
  repository is ever touched from here.

Keep the README's own "Deferred" section as the authoritative, most
current list — this file is a pointer/summary, not a replacement for it.

# Order Management

Generic/Supporting bounded context: order intake, per-line stock allocation,
a capability-derived delivery promise, and choreographed release — the missing upstream
Open Host Service for the `warehouse-systems` fleet. Owns **Order** and
**OrderLine** as first-class aggregates. Before this context existed, "an
order" was just an unowned string (`OrderRef`/`DemandRef`/`Reference`)
independently reinvented by three other services.

Design source of truth: `/Users/claudioed/warehouse-systems/.hermes/plans/2026-08-25_023800-order-management.md`
and the fleet's shared DDD reference docs at `/Users/claudioed/docs/amazon-fulfillment-ddd.md`
and `/Users/claudioed/warehouse-systems-ddd.md`. Honor their ubiquitous
language and strategic classifications.

Study project — not a production system, not affiliated with any real-world
company (see README.md banner).

## Project Overview

- **Module:** `github.com/claudioed/order-management`, Go 1.26.
- **Four binaries, one module:** `cmd/order` (HTTP + Kafka-choreography
  OLTP service), `cmd/mcp` (MCP read server, ADR-0010), `cmd/order-projector`
  (analytics writer, ADR-0006), `cmd/order-reports` (analytics read-only API).
- **Public intent, one command.** Since ADR-0005, a caller expresses "place
  an order" via `POST /orders` alone — allocation and release happen inside
  that same call as a folded, best-effort saga. There is no public
  `/allocate` verb; `POST /orders/{id}/release` exists only for orders
  received with `releaseOnAllocation=false` (ADR-0020 hold).
- **Suppliers:** `inventory-storage` (synchronous HTTP, `POST /reservations`,
  `GET /products/{sku}/classification`) and `wes-work-planning` (release via
  Kafka choreography — no HTTP call). Consumes Kafka facts from
  `process-path-management`, `wes-work-planning` and `fulfillment-execution`
  (ADR-0013..0018). `network-fulfillment` is an inbound HTTP caller
  (ADR-0020). See `.claude/rules/bounded-context-boundary.md`.

## Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE — identical shape to the other fleet services)

Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters, enforced by an `arch-go` fitness test
(`internal/architecture/architecture_test.go`, CI job `arch-test`). Strict
dependency rule: **domain depends on nothing; application depends on
domain; adapters depend on application/domain.** No framework, HTTP, or SQL
type ever appears in the domain layer.

**Note on `web/`:** owns its own `package.json`/build/dev-server (`:5181`),
talks only to this service's own REST API, and never participates in
`make check`/`check-all`. See `.claude/rules/frontend-mfe.md`.

Full CI job list, coverage/mutation gates, and the docs-drift check live in
`.claude/rules/ci-quality-gates.md` — read it before touching `.github/workflows/`
or `apis/*.yaml`.

## Code Standards / Testing

- gofmt/go vet clean; every package has a doc comment.
- `.golangci.yml` copied verbatim from `inventory-storage`'s own config.
- Table-driven tests: domain + application layers use the in-memory adapter
  and fake HTTP clients — **never hit a real network in a unit test.**
  Kafka-touching `-tags=integration` tests use **testcontainers**, never a
  skip-gated `KAFKA_BROKERS` env check (CI's `integration` job provisions no
  external broker; testcontainers is the only variant that actually runs).
- One httptest per REST endpoint: at least one success and one error path.
- Every named invariant in `.claude/rules/domain-model.md` needs a dedicated
  failing-path test.
- Coverage gate: **90%** on `./internal/domain/...,./internal/application/...`.
- Mutation gate (gremlins, `mutation-fast` on every push/PR, full `mutation`
  weekly): thresholds efficacy 89 / mutant-coverage 83 on
  `internal/domain/order` (measured 89.29% / 83.58%) — see `.gremlins.yaml`.
  Do not let a change silently regress below the pinned threshold.
- godog/BDD acceptance suite: `features/*.feature`, run via
  `go test ./... -run TestFeatures` (CI job `bdd`).

## Where the rest of the detail lives

This file is the index. Full DDD/tactical detail, API contracts, ADR
summaries, and CI mechanics are split into `.claude/rules/` so this file
stays short and current:

- **`.claude/rules/bounded-context-boundary.md`** — the Customer/Supplier
  rule, what this repo MUST NOT do (import Go packages, touch another
  service's DB).
- **`.claude/rules/domain-model.md`** — ubiquitous language, aggregate
  invariants (BR2/BR3/BR6), the 10 domain events, the promise and hold
  concepts, and the folded allocate-then-release use-case flow (ADR-0005).
- **`.claude/rules/api-contracts.md`** — the REST endpoints, the exact
  outbound HTTP contracts to inventory-storage, the Kafka integration/
  analytics/inbound channels (asyncapi.yaml) and local-cache consumers,
  and the MCP tools.
- **`.claude/rules/adrs.md`** — one-line summary + link for all 20 ADRs,
  including which ones supersede an earlier one.
- **`.claude/rules/ci-quality-gates.md`** — every CI job (`lint`, `test`,
  `bdd`, `integration`, `mutation-fast`, `vuln`, `api-lint`, `arch-test`,
  `docs-api-drift`, `helm-lint`, `web`, `trivy-scan`, `docker-publish`,
  `release`, scheduled `mutation`/`drift`, plus `codeql`, `scorecard`,
  `docs`), branch triggers, and the OpenAPI/AsyncAPI drift-regeneration
  procedure.
- **`.claude/rules/deferred-and-known-gaps.md`** — what is deliberately NOT
  built yet, and why each gap is a decision, not an oversight.
- **`.claude/rules/frontend-mfe.md`** — the `web/` micro-frontend remote,
  its isolation from the Go module, CORS config.

## Git workflow

GitFlow: `feature/*` branches off `develop`, PR into `develop`
(`gh pr create --base develop`); `develop` promotes to `main` for release.
Do not merge your own PR — leave it open for independent review. Do not
force-push over history once pushed.
